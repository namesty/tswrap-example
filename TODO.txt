* showcase subinvocation -> urgent
* rename js -> javascript
* rename to typescript because bindings are different
* put args into their own namespace -> pascalcased
* check shim dependencies
* shim globals -> explore
* explore building schema from code, not the other way around
* make the CLI (?)/maybe a wrap capable of producing a buildable script file from a TS file
